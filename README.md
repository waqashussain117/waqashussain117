## 🎯 What I Do

I develop **production-grade geological modeling software** that processes terabyte-scale seismic datasets and powers critical infrastructure decisions. My work bridges computational geoscience, computer vision, and software engineering—currently deployed by Italy's Geological Survey (ISPRA) and GFZ Helmholtz Centre.

**Current Focus:** Leading development of [PZero](https://github.com/gecos-lab/PZero), an open-source 3D/4D geological modeling platform used for national infrastructure planning.
