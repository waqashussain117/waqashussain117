**Computational Geoscientist | PhD Researcher | Scientific Software Developer**

I work at the intersection of **geology, geometry, and computation**.

My research focuses on building **reliable 3D geological modeling software** that does not collapse when confronted with real geological complexity: faults, intersections, inconsistent data, and scale.

I am particularly interested in the question:
> *How far can we push automation in geological modeling without sacrificing interpretability?*

## What I Actually Build

- **Geological mesh generators** that survive bad input geometry  
- **3D modeling pipelines** integrating seismic and structural data  
- **Geometry-aware ML workflows** for fracture detection and interpretation  

Most of my work is open-source and research-driven.

## Collaboration

I collaborate on problems that involve:
- non-trivial geometry  
- ambiguous geological data  
- software meant to be *used*, not just published  

If that sounds familiar, we’ll probably get along.
